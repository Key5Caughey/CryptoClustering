# CryptoClustering

**Using unsupervised learning to predict affects on 
cryptocurrencies from day to week**

Used sckit-learn to normalize data from CSV file. Created a DataFrame and set the index. Found the best value for 'k' by plotting a line chart to display 'elbow curve'. Used the 'k' means best value to predict clusters and created a scatter plot using hvPlot with the results. Used hover_cols to identify data points
  Optimized clusters using Principle Component Analysis 'PCA'. Create  new DataFrame with PCA results. Used results to find best value for 'k'. Plotted line chart with new values , added new column to DataFrame to store predicted clusters. Created new scatter plot using hvPlot with results , used hover_cols agian to identify data points.
  Used composite plot to compare the results from the two DataFrames, analyzed the impact of fewer features to cluster by using K-Means.
